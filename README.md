# Team Profile Generator

## Description
This app is intended to be a streamlined way to create a professional looking webpage for any employer via the command line. By simply using node and running the "index.js" file, the user is prompted to enter their name, followed by their email address, their employee ID, their role (Manager, Intern, Engineer or Employee). After they've selected their role, depending on their answer, they will be prompted to either enter their GitHub username (for Engineer), their school name (for Intern), or their office number (for Manager). Once all of this information is gathered, the last question in the array is "Would you like to add another team member?" if the answer is "yes," the questions will repeat, otherwise if the answer is "no," the HTML page will then generate and the Team Profile is ready to go. Additionally, please watch the demo video for a step-by-step guide on how to use this app.
